## Assignment
the assignment is to finish the problems from the book, specifically number 1.4.44 1.4.45 and 2.1.13

## 1.4.44 Birthday Problem
Code looks as follows   

the func takes in N, which it then uses to make a array of N, it then proceeds to run 100000 times adding a random number between 0 and N and compares if N has already been in the array with the following code.   

after running the code the expected value and the actual value comes out as this.

where the 100000 is the value of N, and the first line is a one of shot on the function, which doesn't give that good of a picture, while the second is the avg of N * N
